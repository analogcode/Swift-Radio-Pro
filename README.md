It's short & sweet to give you a quick overview.  
Give it a quick watch.

##Features

- LastFM API and iTunes API Integration to automatically download Album Art
- Parses metadata from streams (Track & Artist information)
- Ability to update Stations from server or locally. (Update stations anytime without resubmitting to app store!)
- Displays Artist, Track & Album Art on Lock Screen
- Custom views optimized for iPhone 4s, 5, 6 and 6+ for backwards compatibility
- Compiles with Xcode 7 & Swift 2.0
- Background audio performance
- Search Bar that can be turned on or off to search stations
- Supports local or hosted station images
- "About" screen with ability to send email & visit website
- Uses industry standard SwiftyJSON library for easy JSON manipulation
- Pull to Refresh stations

##Important Notes
- 2.24.16 Update: Share icon added, thanks [@SuperChloe](https://github.com/SuperChloe).  
- 12.30.15 Update: UISearchBar added, thanks [@fethica](https://github.com/fethica). Turn it on/off in the "SwiftRadio-Settings" file.  
- 12.16.15 Update: New branch added using a single radio station.
- 12.14.15 Update: LastFM has reopened their API signups. Get one at [last.fm/api](http://www.last.fm/api).
- 10.21.15 Update: Added option to use iTunes API to download album art. (See FAQ below). iTunes art is 100px x 100px. i.e. It is smaller than LastFM artwork. So, if you use this API instead, you will want to adjust the UI of your app.
- Volume slider works great in devices, not simulator. This is an Xcode simulator issue.  
- Radio stations in demo are for demonstration purposes only. 
- For a production product, you may want to swap out the MPMoviePlayerController for a more robust streaming library/SDK (with stream stitching, interruption handling, etc).
- Uses Meng To's [Spring](https://github.com/MengTo/Spring) library for animation, making it easy experiment with different UI/UX animations
- SwiftyJSON & Spring are included in the repo to get you up & running quickly. It's on the roadmap to utilize CocoaPods in the future.

##Requirements

- iOS 8.0+ / Mac OS X 10.9+
- Xcode 7

##Setup

The "SwiftRadio-Settings.swift" file contains some project settings to get you started. If you use LastFM, please enter your own LastFM Key.  
Watch this [Getting Started Video](https://youtu.be/m7jiajCHFvc) to get up & running quickly.

##Integration

Includes full Xcode Project to jumpstart development.

##Stations 

Includes an example "stations.json" file. You may upload the JSON file to a server, so that you can update the stations in the app without resubmitting to the app store. The following fields are supported in the app:

- **name**: The name of the station as you want it displayed (e.g. "Sub Pop Radio")

- **streamURL**: The url of the actual stream

- **imageURL**: Station image url. Station images in demo are 350x206. Image can be local or hosted. Leave out the "http" to use a local image (You can use either: "station-subpop" or "http://myurl.com/images/station-subpop.jpg")

- **desc**: Short 2 or 3 word description of the station as you want it displayed (e.g. "Outlaw Country")

- **longDesc**: Long description of the station to be used on the "info screen". This is optional.

##Contributions

Contributions are very welcome. Please create a separate branch (e.g. features/3dtouch). Please do not commit on master.

##FAQ

Q: Do I have to pay you anything if I make an app with this code?  
A: Nope. This is completely open source, you can do whatever you want with it. It's usually cool to thank the project if you use the code. Go build stuff. Enjoy.

Q: How do I use the iTunes API instead of LastFM?  
A: In the SwiftRadio-Settings.swift file, set the "useLastFM" key to "false". You do not need an API key to use the iTunes API. It is free.

Q: The LastFM site isn't working properly? I can't create an API key.  
A: LastFM will sometimes put API signups on hold. You can check back later or try a different API.

Q: It looks like your LastFM api key and secret might have been left in the code?  
A: Yes, people may use it for small amounts of testing. However, I ask that you change it before submitting to the app store. (Plus, it would be self-defeating for someone to submit it to the app store with the testing keys, as it would quickly throttle out and their album art downloads would stop working!)

Q: Is there another API to get album/track information besides LastFM and iTunes?  
A: Rovi has a pretty sweet [music API](http://prod-doc.rovicorp.com/mashery/index.php/Data/APIs/Rovi-Music). The [Echo Nest](http://developer.echonest.com/) has all kinds of APIs that are fun to play with. 

Q: I updated the album art size in the Storyboard, and now the sizing is acting funny?  
A: There is an albumArt constraint modified in the code. See the "optimizeForDeviceSize()" method in the NowPlayingVC.

Q: My radio station isn't playing?  
A: Paste your stream URL into a browser to see if it will play there. The stream may be offline or have a weak connection.

Q: Can you help me add a feature? Can you help me understand the code? Can you help with a problem I'm having?  
A: While I have a full-time job and other project obligations, I'd highly recommend you find a developer or mentor in your area to help. The code is well-documented and most developers should be able to help you rather quickly. While I am sometimes available for paid freelance work, **I am not able to provide any free support or modifications.** Thank you for understanding!

Q: The song names aren't appearing for my station?  
A: Check with your stream provider to make sure they are sending Metadata properly. If a station sends data in a unique way, you can modify the way the app parses the metadata in the "metadataUpdated" method in the NowPlayingViewController.

##Single Station Branch
There's now a branch without the StationsViewController. This is so you can use this code as a starting place for an app for just one radio station. View that [Branch Here](https://github.com/swiftcodex/Swift-Radio-Pro/tree/single-station).

##RadioKit SDK Example 

![alt text](http://matthewfecher.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/radiokit.jpg "RadioKit Example")

- You can use this Swift code as a front-end for a more robust streaming backend.
- Brian Stormont, creator of RadioKit, has created a branch with the professional [RadioKit](http://stormyprods.com/products/radiokit.php) SDK already integrated. **Plus, his branch adds rewind & fast forward stream playback.** This is an excellent learning tool for those who are interested in seeing how a streaming library integrates with Swift Radio Pro. View the [branch here](https://github.com/MostTornBrain/Swift-Radio-Pro/tree/RadioKit).

##Get Creative
Here's a branch of the code that plays streaming TV Stations instead of radio stations. https://github.com/msahins/myTV

If you create an app with the code, or interesting project inspired by the code, shoot me an email: matthew.fecher@gmail.com. Note: As per the FAQ above, I am unable to offer any free support or modifications. Thanks!
